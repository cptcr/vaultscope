# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of VaultScope with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Philosophy

VaultScope is designed as a security assessment tool for localhost environments only. Our security approach includes:

- **Localhost-only operation** - Strict validation prevents external scanning
- **No data collection** - No telemetry or external communication
- **Open source transparency** - All code is publicly auditable
- **Responsible disclosure** - We follow coordinated vulnerability disclosure

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Responsible Disclosure Process

1. **Contact**: Send details to [security@cptcr.dev] with:
   - Detailed vulnerability description
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if any)

2. **Response Timeline**:
   - **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
   - **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
   - **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline
   - **30 days**: Target resolution for critical issues

3. **Disclosure Coordination**:
   - We will work with you to understand the issue
   - Coordinate public disclosure timing
   - Provide credit in security advisories (if desired)
   - Ensure proper fix validation before release

### Vulnerability Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels:

#### Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)
- Remote code execution
- Privilege escalation to system level
- Bypass of all security controls

#### High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)
- Significant data exposure
- Authentication bypass
- Remote denial of service

#### Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)
- Limited data exposure
- Local privilege escalation
- Cross-site scripting in reports

#### Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)
- Information disclosure
- Minor security misconfigurations
- Non-security-impacting bugs

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls

1. **URL Validation**
   - Strict localhost/127.0.0.1 validation
   - Prevention of external network access
   - Input sanitization for all user inputs

2. **Sandboxed Execution**
   - No system-level privileges required
   - Isolated execution environment
   - Limited file system access

3. **Safe Report Generation**
   - Output encoding to prevent XSS
   - Sanitized file paths
   - No executable content in reports

### Ethical Use Enforcement

- Clear warnings about authorized testing only
- Documentation emphasizing responsible use
- Legal disclaimers and usage guidelines
- Community guidelines for ethical security testing

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Only Test Authorized Systems**
   - Use only on systems you own
   - Obtain explicit written permission
   - Follow applicable laws and regulations

2. **Secure Your Environment**
   - Keep VaultScope updated to latest version
   - Run from trusted systems only
   - Secure generated reports appropriately

3. **Responsible Disclosure**
   - Follow responsible disclosure for findings
   - Do not exploit vulnerabilities maliciously
   - Respect system owners and operators

### Installation Security

1. **Download from Official Sources**
   - Use GitHub releases only
   - Verify checksums when provided
   - Avoid unofficial distributions

2. **System Security**
   - Keep Java runtime updated
   - Use proper antivirus software
   - Follow system security best practices

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations

1. **Java Dependencies**

   - Inherits security properties of Java runtime
   - Regular dependency updates required

2. **Report Handling**
   - Generated reports contain sensitive information
   - Users responsible for secure storage
   - No built-in encryption for reports

### Future Security Enhancements

1. **Planned Improvements**
   - Enhanced input validation
   - Report encryption options
   - Digital signature verification
   - Improved sandbox isolation

2. **Ongoing Monitoring**
   - Regular dependency vulnerability scans
   - Automated security testing
   - Community security reviews
